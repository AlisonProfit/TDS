        - the size of the temporal window 
        - the size of the overlap between subsequent windows

        -----

        This function takes as input a sampled signal s and the sampling
        frequency fs and returns the fingerprint (the hashcodes) of the signal.
        The fingerprint is created through the following steps
        - spectrogram computation
        - local maxima extraction
        - hashes creation

        Implement all these operations in this function. Keep as attributes of
        the class the spectrogram, the range of frequencies, the anchors, the 
        list of hashes, etc.

        Each hash can conveniently be represented by a Python dictionary 
        containing the time associated to its anchor (key: "t") and a numpy 
        array with the difference in time between the anchor and the target, 
        the frequency of the anchor and the frequency of the target 
        (key: "hash")

        Implement a code establishing correspondences between the hashes of

        histogram of the offsets between hashes. Finally, search for a criterion
